**<big>As an open-source enthusiast</big>**, I am very active on GitHub and have opened up a few of my projects - some
are listed [here](/projects/). I am also actively involved in a number of other OSS projects - you can keep up with my
latest OSS activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/llorllale). I am an honored participant in the
[Hyperledger Aries Working Group](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries/blob/master/README.md), and both the
[DIDComm](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm/blob/main/README.md) and the
[Confidential Storage](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage/blob/master/README.md) working groups
under the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/).

**<big>My career</big>** started in the telecommunications industry by monitoring and maintaining critical IT systems
with high-availability. I had the pleasure of working with a skilled, proactive, and highly motivated team. Over time I
realized my passion was in software development, and thus embarked on a journey that took me from writing simple programs
in Java and Unix scripts to enterprise JEE development, service-oriented architectures, and microservices written in
Go and deployed to the cloud. 

<br/>

**<big>In my spare time</big>** I am a [powerlifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting), currently with a Wilk's
score of [326](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/georgearisty). I am also a guitar player and proud owner of a
[Jackson Warrior WRXMG](https://www.jacksonguitars.com/gear/shape/warrior/x-series-warrior-wrxmg/2916500503).
