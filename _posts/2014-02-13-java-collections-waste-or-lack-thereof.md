If you are a performance freak who makes sure every collection is initialized with the "right" size then don't be: http://java.dzone.com/articles/java-collection-waste. In all fairness, notice the caveat at the end, though I also suspect that won't be an issue. :)

*Edit 18 Aug 2019:* See the [Java Collections Tutorial](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-collections-tutorial/) on [Java Code Geeks](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/) for a nice introduction to Java's [Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/index.html).
