My name is George Aristy. I am a programmer and an open-source enthusiast.

As a programmer, I specialize in Java and Oracle's SOA Suite. I am an [Oracle Certified Java SE 8 Programmer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c54f640a-f752-4f83-aed9-8294739f532b) and have close to a decade's [experience](https://github.com/llorllale/cv) providing service-oriented solutions within the telecom domain. I have led the way forward with standards and best-practices for SOA development, and have evangelized SOA's benefits for its successful adoption across an IT enterprise.

As an open-source enthusiast, I have opened up a few of my projects - you can browse through them [here](/projects/). I am also actively involved in a number of other OSS projects - you can keep up with my latest OSS activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/llorllale).

My career started in the telecommunications industry by monitoring and maintaining critical IT systems with high-availability. I had the pleasure of working with a skilled, proactive, and higly motivated team. Over time though I realized that I saw myself more as a *builder* than a maintainer and thus embarked on my journey through software development, focused primarily on systems integration using Java EE technologies. 

In my spare time I am a [powerlifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting), currently with a (meh?) Wilk's score of [326](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/georgearisty). I am also a guitar player and a proud owner of a [Jackson Warrior WRXMG](https://www.jacksonguitars.com/gear/shape/warrior/x-series-warrior-wrxmg/2916500503).
