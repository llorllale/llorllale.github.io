<strong><big>As a programmer</big></strong>, I specialize in backends, whether these are on a standard JEE stack, on Oracleâ€™s SOA Suite,
or written in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go">Go</a>. I am an

In my latest adventure I have immersed myself in the exciting world of digital identity and authorization, bridging the old
world of OAuth2/OIDC with new emerging standards centered around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-sovereign identity</a>
and <a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf">Privacy by Design</a> by leveraging
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>,
and <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a>.</p>

<strong><big>My career</big></strong> started in the telecommunications industry by monitoring and maintaining critical IT systems
with high-availability. I had the pleasure of working with a skilled, proactive, and highly motivated team. Over time I
realized my passion was in software development, and thus embarked on a journey that took me from writing simple programs
in Java and Unix scripts to enterprise JEE development, service-oriented architectures, and microservices.</p>

<p><strong><big>In my spare time</big></strong> I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting">powerlifter</a>, currently with a Wilkâ€™s
