My name is **<big>George Aristy</big>**. I am a programmer and an open-source enthusiast.

**<big>As a programmer</big>**, I specialize in backends, whether these are on a standard JEE stack, on Oracle's SOA Suite,
or written in [Go](https://github.com/golang/go). I am an
[Oracle Certified Java SE 8 Programmer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c54f640a-f752-4f83-aed9-8294739f532b) and have
close to a decade's [experience](https://github.com/llorllale/cv) providing service-oriented solutions within the telecom domain.

In my latest adventure I have immersed myself in the exciting world of digital identity and authorization, bridging the old
world of OAuth2/OIDC with new emerging standards centered around [Self-sovereign identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity)
and [Privacy by Design](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf) by leveraging
[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/),
and [DIDComm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/).

**<big>As an open-source enthusiast</big>**, I am very active on GitHub and have opened up a few of my projects - some
are listed [here](/projects/). I am also actively involved in a number of other OSS projects - you can keep up with my
latest OSS activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/llorllale). I am an honored participant in the
[Hyperledger Aries Working Group](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries/blob/master/README.md), and both the
[DIDComm](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm/blob/main/README.md) and the
[Confidential Storage](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage/blob/master/README.md) working groups
under the [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/).

**<big>My career</big>** started in the telecommunications industry by monitoring and maintaining critical IT systems
with high-availability. I had the pleasure of working with a skilled, proactive, and highly motivated team. Over time I
realized my passion was in software development, and thus embarked on a journey that took me from writing simple programs
in Java and Unix scripts to enterprise JEE development, service-oriented architectures, and microservices.

<br/>

**<big>In my spare time</big>** I am a [powerlifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting), currently with a Wilk's
score of [326](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/georgearisty). I am also a guitar player and proud owner of a
[Jackson Warrior WRXMG](https://www.jacksonguitars.com/gear/shape/warrior/x-series-warrior-wrxmg/2916500503).
