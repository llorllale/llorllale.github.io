I came across this issue today and someone else already blogged about it: http://hoskinator.blogspot.com/2006/11/trouble-using-pipe-with-stringsplit.html. Some of the comments are really good!<br /><br />The pipe character is not mentioned in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Pattern</a> javadoc.<br /><br />Basically, just escape the pipe character with double backslashes like so <span style="font-style: italic;">"\\|</span>" and you're set.<br /><br />This post merely provides redundancy in case the above link goes extinct...
