[Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming](https://www.amazon.ca/Learning-Go-Idiomatic-Real-World-Programming/dp/1492077216)


- Pros:
  - teaches idioms
  - starts at the basics of tooling, basic data types, then slowly progresses to more complicated subjects (TODO)
  - uses coding examples

- idioms
  - comma-OK
  - map as set

- TODO things I learned:
  - support for complex numbers! (p24)
  - a slice taken from a slice shares the same backing array (p44-45)
  - strings and runes and bytes (p48)
  - struct conversion (p59)
- TODO Outdated?
  - converting arrays to slices (p46)
