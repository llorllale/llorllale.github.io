**Welcome to the new blog!**

I'm sunsetting the old [blog](http://llorllale.blogspot.com/) and migrating all posts here, closer to my public code.

The move also allows version control (always welcome) and better automation (via 'git push' to master branch).

I'm using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build this blog. Things I've yet to properly figure out:

1. Preferred comment system. Apparently, minima only supports disqus out-of-the-box and I'm afraid of ads introduced through it.
2. A decent theme for this blog. I've enabled jekyll's default [theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) for now since the one I liked best doesn't work on jekyll 3.3.1 (the version that github [currently supports](https://pages.github.com/versions/)).
3. How to properly link to my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgearisty). The minima theme doesn't seem to support it.

**What I'll be posting about**

I've always had a passion for programming, and I'm a strong believer in the open-source movement, so I'll definitely be writing related to that. Checkout my code at [github](http://github.com/llorllale).

On the personal level, I've been passionate about powerlifting for around 18 months or so, so look out for a few posts here and there on that. And, perhaps - *drum roll* - if I ever get serious again about guitar playing, I'll be posting some of that as well!
