I"]<p>Recently I had to perform some load tests on an application that received its input via a Weblogic JMS queue, hence making the rate of message consumption one of the key metrics to keep track of and compare to a known standard.<br /><br />Developing the WLST script proved a bit challenging only for the fact that all documentation of what constitutes “total pending messages” in the queue is a bit ambiguous (Oracle Weblogic’s own documentation being the worst of all). So I did a little digging around and some experimenting and present to you here a graph which I think illustrates quite succinctly what it’s all about:<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9NoC6SLgCH8/UnUSVo1jhSI/AAAAAAAAAQo/GBW1kC7WF5M/s1600/image001.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9NoC6SLgCH8/UnUSVo1jhSI/AAAAAAAAAQo/GBW1kC7WF5M/s400/image001.png" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />“Messages pending” seem to be the working buffer (tier 1) from where the MDBs consume the messages. “Messages current” seem to be a secondary buffer (tier 2, probably serialized to disk) which are fed into “messages pending” whenever there’s available capacity in the latter.<br /><br />For proof, notice how “messages current” starts climbing only after “messages pending” has reached a certain level, and notice how “messages current” is the first to drop to zero, after which “messages pending” falls to zero as well.<br /><br />By the way, “messages processed” in the graph was calculated using the simple formula: msgs_received - (msgs_current + msgs_pending).</p>
