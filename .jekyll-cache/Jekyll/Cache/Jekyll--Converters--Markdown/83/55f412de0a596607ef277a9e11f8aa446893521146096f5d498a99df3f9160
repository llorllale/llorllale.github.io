I"#<p>Unable to get rid of the 400 error when running a build to deploy your artifact to a maven repository? Have you read about how the sources:jar goal is <a href="http://blog.peterlynch.ca/2010/05/maven-how-to-prevent-generate-sources.html" target="_blank">executed twice</a> and then tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10794985" target="_blank">overriding</a> that behavior? Still not working?<br /><br />Well, if you’re like me and you are blindly running your build from Netbeans, you might want to verify that you’re not executing both the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference" target="_blank">install and deploy</a> goals. Run them separately and your artifact should be uploaded to your repo without issue. :)</p>
