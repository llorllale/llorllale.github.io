I"]<p>It’s been a while!<br /><br />Anyway, this post’s catalyst occurred this morning during my first day of a Java course I’m attending (an attempt at keeping my teeth sharp). As is custom, use of an IDE is not supported and instead attendants are to use a “normal text editor” (we all know Vim is far from “normal text editor” but bare with me here :P).<br /><br />It suddenly struck me: it was time to fiddle around with code completion in Vim.<br /><br />Quickly dug around and found that Vim <span style="font-weight: bold;">already</span> had code completion for some common languages (from version 7 onwards)! Java was unfortunately not on the list so I had to look for a third party solution. So far I have come across <a href="http://www.blogger.com/eclim.org">eclim</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1213">VJDE</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1213">java complete.</a> I didn’t like eclim’s design (running a server with which vim would interface), and I couldn’t make VJDE work for some reason, but <span style="font-style: italic;">java complete</span> has so far been working wonders:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBtuK4Rec6Y/TKf7U8M0MDI/AAAAAAAAAF0/2SdOmOU5dXk/s1600/vim_javacomplete.PNG"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XBtuK4Rec6Y/TKf7U8M0MDI/AAAAAAAAAF0/2SdOmOU5dXk/s320/vim_javacomplete.PNG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5523659805169037362" border="0" /></a>Just one more reason to love Vim! :D</p>
