I'm a software developer residing in the Dominican Republic with years of experience developing Java Middleware (JEE, Oracle SOA) and providing OPs support for Java + Unix-based systems.

On my free time you can find me hitting the local gym improving my powerlifting total, walking my dog, tinkering around in my laptop, and videogaming a little.
