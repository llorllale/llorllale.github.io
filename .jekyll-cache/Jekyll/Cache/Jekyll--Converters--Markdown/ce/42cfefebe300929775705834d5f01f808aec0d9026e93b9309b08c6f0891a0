I"<p>I didn’t code it. But I’m part of the team in charge of completing the project and maintaining it.<br /><br />Oh yeah. The project consists of an integration layer between different systems; it is implemented on top of Oracle’s SOA Suite. There are many BPEL processes, ESBs, web services, etc. <br /><br />Since it’s <i>Oracle’s</i> SOA Suite, we use JDeveloper (dear <i>god</i>, don’t get me started) and Oracle Database. We color-coordinated everything - we’re cool like that. The only other caveat is that there are a few stored procedures here and there, as well as some triggers. <i>Triggers</i>. Containing business logic. Like, <i>if this new row in table X has the “status” column set to 123, then update tables A, B, C, D and E with status 456</i>.<br /><br />It’s pretty much guaranteed that <b>you will fail to pin point this mechanism in a reasonable amount of time the first time you come across such a scenario</b>. It’s a pretty big context switch and will surely be the last thing that you will check.<br /><br />This <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/75487/how-to-suggest-using-an-orm-instead-of-stored-procedures" target="_blank">post</a> on StackExchange reminded me of all this while I lay cool sipping on a cold beer at my home.</p>
