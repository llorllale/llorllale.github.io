I"<<p><strong>Welcome to the new blog!</strong></p>

<p>I’m sunsetting the old <a href="http://llorllale.blogspot.com/">blog</a> and migrating all posts here, closer to my public code.</p>

<p>The move also allows version control (always welcome) and better automation (via ‘git push’ to master branch).</p>

<p>I’m using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> to build this blog. Things I’ve yet to properly figure out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Preferred comment system. Apparently, minima only supports disqus out-of-the-box and I’m afraid of ads introduced through it.</li>
  <li>A decent theme for this blog. I’ve enabled jekyll’s default <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">theme</a> for now since the one I liked best doesn’t work on jekyll 3.3.1 (the version that github <a href="https://pages.github.com/versions/">currently supports</a>).</li>
  <li>How to properly link to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgearisty">linkedin profile</a>. The minima theme doesn’t seem to support it.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What I’ll be posting about</strong></p>

<p>I’ve always had a passion for programming, and I’m a strong believer in the open-source movement, so I’ll definitely be writing related to that. Checkout my code at <a href="http://github.com/llorllale">github</a>.</p>

<p>On the personal level, I’ve been passionate about powerlifting for around 18 months or so, so look out for a few posts here and there on that. And, perhaps - <em>drum roll</em> - if I ever get serious again about guitar playing, I’ll be posting some of that as well!</p>
