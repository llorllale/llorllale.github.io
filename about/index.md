My name is **<big>George Aristy</big>**. I am a programmer and an open-source enthusiast.

**<big>As a programmer</big>**, I specialize in Java backends, whether these are on a standard JEE stack or on Oracle's SOA Suite.  I am an [Oracle Certified Java SE 8 Programmer](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c54f640a-f752-4f83-aed9-8294739f532b) and have close to a decade's [experience](https://github.com/llorllale/cv) providing service-oriented solutions within the telecom domain. I have led the way forward with standards and best-practices for SOA development, and have evangelized SOA's benefits for its successful adoption across an IT enterprise.

**<big>As an open-source enthusiast</big>**, I am very active on GitHub and have opened up a few of my projects - some are listed [here](/projects/). I am also actively involved in a number of other OSS projects - you can keep up with my latest OSS activity on [GitHub](https://github.com/llorllale).

**<big>My career</big>** started in the telecommunications industry by monitoring and maintaining critical IT systems with high-availability. I had the pleasure of working with a skilled, proactive, and higly motivated team. Over time I realized my passion was in software development, and thus embarked on a journey that took me from writing simple programs in Java and Unix scripts to enterprise JEE development, service-oriented architectures, and microservices.

<br/>

**<big>In my spare time</big>** I am a [powerlifter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting), currently with a Wilk's score of [326](https://symmetricstrength.com/lifter/georgearisty). I am also a guitar player and proud owner of a [Jackson Warrior WRXMG](https://www.jacksonguitars.com/gear/shape/warrior/x-series-warrior-wrxmg/2916500503).
