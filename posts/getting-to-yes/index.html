That’s right - the goal is to engage in <em>principled</em> negotiation. Do not let the title mislead you into thinking it’s a box of tricks for you to unilaterally “get your way”.</p><p>Roger and William are both professors at Harvard and founders of the <a href="https://www.pon.harvard.edu/">Harvard Negotiation Project</a>.</p><p>The book is a short and accessible read, suitable for everyone, including software engineers such as myself. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to level up beyond their soft skills as a professional.</p><p><em>Check out some other books I’ve read on the <a href="/bookshelf/">bookshelf</a>.</em></p><h1 id="summary">Summary</h1><p><em>Getting to Yes</em> exhorts parties in a negotiation to pivot away from the typical positional bargaining tactics, and into negotiation based on principles, standards and interests independent of the will of any single party.</p><p>The game of positional bargaining involves locking the “terrain” upfront by staking initial (and often extreme) positions, yielding as little as possible in a pre-established vector of negotiation while making the other side yield as much as possible along the same line.</p><p>In contrast, principled negotiation leaves the field open for collaborative exploration of the underlying interests and the universe of options that can address those interests, based on objective criteria, all while separating the people from the problem. The goal is to produce wiser agreements more efficiently and in a way that preserves relationships.</p><p>The book is laden with great examples ranging from a fictional tenant negotiating the rent with their landlord to real life examples where countries avoid war due to clever negotiation tactics. Here’s one of my favorites that showcases the advantages of focusing on interests and not positions:</p><blockquote><p>[…] two men are quarreling in a library. One wants the window open and the other wants it closed. They bicker back and forth about how much to leave it open: a crack, halfway, three-quarters of the way. No solution satisfies them both.</p><p>Enter the librarian. She asks one why he wants the window open: “To get some fresh air.” She asks the other why he wants it closed: “To avoid the draft.” After thinking a minute, she opens wide a window in the next room, bringing in fresh air without a draft.</p></blockquote><p>The book includes sobering chapters on what to do if the other side won’t play the game of principled negotiation and/or is more powerful. These sections really serve to round off the excellent treatise on principled negotiation by acknowledging circumstances where the method may not work and presents the reader with options in those cases.</p><p>Lastly, the book acknowledges that readers are probably already aware of most of what it teaches at some level of their experience. The goal in writing the book was to organize these common ideas and experiences into a usable framework.</p><h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1><p>I am a software engineer with experience ranging from individual contributions in big hierarchical organizations to more collaborative team work in flat “startups” doing pair-programming.</p><p>Despite the romanticized view of a software engineer with their hoody pulled over their head and earphones plugged into the sides of their heads, software engineering is a social endeavour. There is always some level of collaboration needed with other software engineers, operations, DBAs, helpdesk, product managers, your manager, etc.</p><p>Software engineers like to debate <em>a lot</em>. Too many pointless arguments about details that don’t really matter in the long run. I’ve been guilty of this and have just bruises and scars to show for it. The world keeps turning; the business keeps operating.</p><p>Sometimes you really <em>do</em> have to sit down and negotiate on something worthwhile, but these instances are few and far in between. I think that of far more value is the wisdom to distinguish between that which is worthwhile and that which isn’t<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Because one thing that <em>Getting to YES</em> confirms is that principled negotiation can require <em>a lot</em> of effort. Brainstorming, inventing options, etc. Use wisely.</p><p>Reading <em>Getting to YES</em> gives me comfort in recognition and validation of my system of thought, but it won’t make me a negotiator “superhero” who can win every negotiation. Sometimes the balance of BATNA (see definition below) is tilted against you, the other side is aware of it, and there is nothing you can do to make up the difference. Other times the age-old saying applies: you cannot reason someone out of something he or she was not reasoned into. You can’t reason against a working culture.</p><p>Still, <em>Getting to YES</em> provides me a structured framework that fits my style and a checklist of things to do and things to watch out for. I intend to keep this book on my shelf for a long, long time.</p><h1 id="the-problems-with-positional-bargaining">The Problems with Positional Bargaining</h1><h2 id="unwise-outcomes"><span class="mr-2">Unwise outcomes</span><a href="#unwise-outcomes" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Positional bargainers remain locked in their initial positions at the expense of creativity and the discovery of the underlying interests.</p><h2 id="inefficient"><span class="mr-2">Inefficient</span><a href="#inefficient" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Parties hold extreme positions, conceding as little as necessary to keep the negotiation going.

One side may decide to switch to a soft style by being generous in order to preserve the relationship on good terms. This makes reaching an agreement likely and faster, but not necessarily a wise agreement. Anger and resentment may still brew under the surface, and the soft bargainer becomes vulnerable to the hard bargainer. As the book says, “if your response to hard positional bargaining is soft positional bargaining, you will probably lose your shirt”.</p><h1 id="getting-to-yes-without-giving-in-the-method">Getting to YES without giving in: The Method</h1><h2 id="1-separate-the-people-from-the-problem"><span class="mr-2">1.

No book on gardening can teach you to grow lilies in a desert or a cactus in a swamp. If you enter an antique store to buy a sterling silver George IV tea set worth thousands of dollars and all you have is a one hundred-dollar bill, you should not expect skillful negotiation to overcome the difference. In any negotiation there exist realities that are hard to change. In response to power, the most any method of negotiation can do is to meet two objectives: first, to protect you against making an agreement you should reject and second, to help you make the most of the assets you do have so that any agreement you reach will satisfy your interests as well as possible.</p><p>Chapter 6, <em>What If They Are More Powerful?</em></p></blockquote><p>You should not expect miracles from reading this book. You should not expect to out-negotiate your boss when he has all the power. The best you can do is develop your <strong>BATNA</strong> and use as a baseline to gauge options and protect your interests as best you can.</p><dl><dt>BATNA<dd>Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement</dl><p>Avoid setting a bottom line<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. You don’t want to develop a blindspot and shut down creative solutions, nor do you want to run the risk of setting your bottom line too high. Rather, develop your BATNA. Instead of asking yourself what your bottom line is, ask yourself <em>what will you do if an agreement is not reached at all</em>. Doing so opens up more options for you if you think about it. You are no longer locked into <em>having</em> to make an agreement with the other side - you can simply walk away if your BATNA is sufficiently attractive. This is tremendously liberating. Another benefit of knowing your BATNA is that it focuses your mind away from fixed criteria (price, time, etc.) and opens is up to more creative options. The solution space is enlarged by magnitudes. Not knowing your BATNA means you are negotiating blind.</p><blockquote><p>[…] the greater danger is that you are <em>too</em> committed to reach an agreement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The better your BATNA, the greater your power […] the relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement.</p><p>Chapter 6, <em>What If They Are More Powerful?</em></p></blockquote><p>Knowing your own BATNA is great, but you should <strong>consider knowing the other side’s BATNA</strong>. Their BATNA may be better for them than any fair solution you can imagine. You may have to work hard to change their BATNA.</p><p><strong>Formulate a tripwire</strong>: this is not a bottom line; this is an intermediary point better than your BATNA but far from your ideal agreement. When this wire is tripped, you should sit back and assess the situation.</p><p><strong>When the other side is more powerful</strong> then your best assets are the merits of your argument. The larger a role you can establish for principle the better off you are.</p><h2 id="-they-wont-play"><span class="mr-2">… they won’t play?</span><a href="#-they-wont-play" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p><strong>Use negotiation jujitsu</strong>:</p><ul><li>Recast an attack on you as an attack on the problem.<li>Don’t attack their positions, look behind it.<li>Don’t defend your ideas, invite criticism and advice.<ul><li>“What concerns of yours would this proposal fail to take into account?”.<li>Ask them for advice.
