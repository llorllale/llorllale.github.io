<pre><blockquote>The master programmer moves from<br />program to program without fear.<br />No change in management can harm<br />him. He will not be fired, even<br />if the project is cancelled.Why<br />is this? He is filled with Tao.</blockquote><br /><br /><br /><blockquote>The novice programmer stares in<br />wonder at the bird, for he<br />understands it not. The average<br />programmer dreads the coming of<br />the bird, for he fears its<br />message. The master programmer<br />continues to work at his terminal,<br />for he does not know that the<br />bird has come and gone.</blockquote><br />Classic!<br /><br />PS: Not to be confused with the <a href="http://thetaoishere.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.<br /></pre>
